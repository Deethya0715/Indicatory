1. The End-to-End System:
A mobile app that can connect to the dongle via Bluetooth.
The ability to start and stop a "trip" (e.g., a "Start Drive" button and an "End Drive" button).
The app must be able to receive raw data from the dongle while the user is driving.
The app must securely send the raw trip data to your backend server.
Your backend server must receive, store, and process the data.
The server must run your scoring algorithm to generate a single, simple score for that trip.
The app must be able to display the score to the user at the end of the trip.
2. The App's User Interface (UI):
Onboarding: A simple screen that guides the user to plug in the dongle and pair it with their phone.
Dashboard: A basic home screen with a single "Start Drive" button.
Trip Summary: One screen that shows the final score for the completed trip and a simple map of the route.
3. The Map Integration:
Display a map of the trip.
Use a single type of marker (e.g., a pin) to indicate where a turn was made, and whether an indicator was used. This is enough to prove the concept without complex color-coding.

Bluetooth connections:
For both IOS and Android:
Request Permissions: Your app must ask the user for permission to use Bluetooth and Location services.
Scan for Devices: Your app will scan for nearby BLE devices that are advertising their services. You'll filter for the Veepeak dongle by its name (VEEPEAK) or service ID.
Connect to the Device: Once you find the Veepeak, your app will initiate a connection to it.
Read and Write Data: After a successful connection, your app can read data from and write commands to the dongle.
IOS Connections: 
iOS has a robust framework for handling BLE called Core Bluetooth.
Declare Permissions: In your Info.plist file, you must add a key called NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription with a string explaining why your app needs to use Bluetooth. For example: "We need Bluetooth to connect to your OBD-II device to track your driving."
Implement the Code:
Create an instance of CBCentralManager. This object represents your app as the "central" device that will manage connections.
The central manager will notify your app about its state changes (e.g., if Bluetooth is powered on).
Use scanForPeripherals(withServices:options:) to start scanning for devices. You can scan for a specific service UUID or for all available devices.
When a device is discovered, your app will get a callback with a CBPeripheral object. You can check the peripheral's name to see if it matches "VEEPEAK".
Call connect(peripheral:) to connect to the dongle.
Once connected, you will discover the dongle's services and characteristics by calling discoverServices() and discoverCharacteristics(). The OBD-II data is contained within a specific characteristic.
Use readValue(for:) and writeValue(_:for:type:) to read data from and write commands to the dongle.
Android Connections:
Declare Permissions: In your AndroidManifest.xml file, you must declare several permissions:
BLUETOOTH_CONNECT: To connect to paired devices.
BLUETOOTH_SCAN: To scan for nearby Bluetooth devices.
ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION: Required for BLE scanning on Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) and higher.
Request Runtime Permissions: For Android 6.0 and above, you must ask the user for permission at runtime. This means your app will show a pop-up to the user asking for permission to access Bluetooth and location.
Implement the Code:
Get a BluetoothManager instance.
Use BluetoothLeScanner to start scanning for nearby BLE devices. You will get a list of devices in a callback method.
In the callback, check the device name to see if it matches "VEEPEAK".
Once you find the device, call connectGatt() to establish a connection.
After connecting, you will discover the device's GATT services and characteristics. The OBD-II data is transmitted through a specific characteristic that you will need to find in the dongle's documentation.
Use readCharacteristic() or writeCharacteristic() to send your PID commands and read the response.
specific GATT service and characteristic UUIDs that you will use to communicate with the dongle.

Screen Info:

1. Onboarding & Setup ⚙️
These pages guide the user through the initial setup, from downloading the app to connecting the dongle.
Welcome/Intro Screen: A simple screen with a brief explanation of the app and a button to get started.
Bluetooth Pairing Screen: This screen will have instructions on how to plug in the dongle and will manage the Bluetooth connection. You can use an animated graphic or a series of simple illustrations to show the process.
Permissions Screen: This page will request the necessary permissions from the user, such as Bluetooth and Location, with a brief explanation of why they are needed.

2. The Core App Functionality 🚗
This is the main dashboard and the driving screen.
Main Dashboard: This is the primary home screen of your app. It should feature a large, prominent button to start a new drive and a high-level summary of the user's overall driving score.
Live Driving Screen: A simple, minimalist screen that shows the user their trip is in progress. Avoid clutter. It should show a timer and a map of their current route.

3. Post-Trip Review & History 🏆
These pages deliver the core value of your app: the score and the feedback.
Trip Summary Screen: This is the most important page. It should display the final driving score for the trip and a visual summary of the drive. The screen should have three key elements:
The final score (e.g., a large number or a simple gauge).
An embedded map showing the route.
A simple list of events (e.g., "3 sharp turns detected," "Used indicator on all turns").
Trip History Screen: A simple list of all past trips. Each item on the list should show the date, a short summary (e.g., "Good Drive"), and a simple score. Tapping an item should lead to the detailed Trip Summary screen.
Colors: 

Color
Primary colors: 
#1e1e1e	
The dominant color for all backgrounds and screens. This deep charcoal is easy on the eyes and provides a perfect canvas for all car and UI colors.

Primary Accent:	
#00FFFF	
Used for key action buttons, data visualizations, and your high-score indicator. This electric cyan represents progress, technology, and a clean, fresh feel.

Secondary Accent:

This bright orange should be used sparingly for warnings, error states (like a poor driving score), or to draw attention to important, but not primary, information.

Main Text:
#F5F5F5	
A slightly off-white color that is highly readable on the dark background without causing eye strain.

Secondary Text:	
#888888	
A lighter gray for subheadings, descriptive text, and less important information to create a visual hierarchy.
